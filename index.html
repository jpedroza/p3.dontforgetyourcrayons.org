	This project is the first phase of the Army's "Partners in Education" effort to lend a helping hand in developing the Future Leaders.  
	Soldiers and Civilians from the Brigade Modernization Command in Fort Bliss, Texas have joined forces to put together some "Cool" ways to help Morehead Middle School students learn about the importance of math.
	This simulator is one of many proposed projects that are focused on providing a deeper appreciation for Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Velocity, Acceleration, and Gravity, etc.
